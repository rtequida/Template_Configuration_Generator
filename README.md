# Template Configuration Generator
 A simple GUI to configure layer 2 and 3 network devices to a specific standard. Provides the user with a set of text entry boxes for every part of the configuration file that is unique to each switch/router installation. The script will then populate a preconfigured text file with the given values and provide the user with the newly populated text file to be directly uploaded into their device.
